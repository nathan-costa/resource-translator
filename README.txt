This utility is designed for developers who wish to automate the insertion of translations into .net .resx files.

The utility creates a key/value across all resource files for a given string, the key remains the same and the value is translated to the appropriate language.

The Bing Translator API is used to provide the translations.

If a given key exists in any of the current resource files, no data will be written.
